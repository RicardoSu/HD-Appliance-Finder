The large oven includes two adjustable racks that can be rearranged on four glide positions. The waist-high broiler is located inside the oven, ensuring you won't have to bend down to the floor to transfer your pans when accessing the broiling compartment. The ADA compliant design features upfront push-to-turn knobs preventing users from reaching over hot burners to manage cooking. Indicator lights on the control panel show when a burner or the oven is on. The high rear back guard helps to protect your walls from spills. This unit is constructed from porcelain and steel for lasting durability. It does not include a power cord but is compatible with standard 40 Amp range cords 3 or 4-wire. Additional slim-fitting ranges and matching range hoods are available.",
