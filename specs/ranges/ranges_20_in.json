Model REX2071SSRT1 is a 20 in. wide 220-Volt electric range with a smooth ceramic glass cooking surface complete with 4 1200-Watt elements. Sized just over 24 in. deep, it's ideal for apartments, tiny homes, hotels, and other kitchens with limited space. It ships with a short stainless steel back guard that can be removed to create a more traditional slide-in look. The large oven includes 2 adjustable racks and a waist-high broiler that allows you to switch from bake to broil without moving your dishes. The large oven window and interior light let you monitor your cooking without opening the door to release heat and disrupt the baking process. Upfront push-to-turn controls ensure you won't have to reach over the hot surface to adjust, helping to comply with ADA guidelines for accessibility. Indicator lights on the control panel show when a burner or the oven is on and if the surface is still hot. The stainless steel doors with black accents bring a modern look ideal for any kitchen. This unit is constructed from porcelain and steel for lasting durability. It does not include a power cord but is compatible with standard 40 amp range cords (3 or 4-wire). Additional slim-fitting ranges and matching range hoods are available. Note: this unit does not include a lower storage compartment.",
