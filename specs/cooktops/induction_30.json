        "Description": "The True Induction TI-4B cooktop is an energy efficient top that offers the perfect union of a sleek design and advanced technology. With quick response times, even heat and instant heat adjustments, the True Induction cooktop is a state of the art model at a better value than the competition. In fact, the high quality and affordable price is what makes the True Induction brand worthy of being used by Winnebago RVs, as well as a handful of other RV manufacturers. The unit has a black ceramic glass surface which is made for easy cleaning. All that is needed is a damp cloth to wipe down the top surface to keep it looking brand new for years to come. The 30 inch cooktop can be installed right into the counter itself, forming a seamless surface to prep and cook with. Additionally, since the unit is not attached to an oven, it can be installed it wherever it will be the most accessible and leave the most room to work with. The unit runs off of a 240V outlet using 7400 watts, allowing all four burners to work at the same time.",
