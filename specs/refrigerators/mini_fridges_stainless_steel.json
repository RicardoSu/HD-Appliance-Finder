The CT661BIWADA Series features residential refrigerator-freezers made in Europe and designed for reliable cold storage under lower ADA counters. Sized with a 24 in. footprint, the CT661WBISSHVADALHD refrigerator-freezer offers a generous 5.1 cu. ft. storage capacity, larger than many units in this size class. The 32 in. H and front-breathing design makes it ideal for installation under lower counters complying with ADA guidelines for height restriction. The fully finished cabinet also enables freestanding use. This unit comes with a white cabinet and stainless steel wrapped door with a left hand door swing. A sleek stainless steel handle completes the professional look. Inside, the CT661WBISSHVADALHD features a dual evaporator to allow separated cooling of the fresh and frozen food sections. The refrigerated compartment utilizes low maintenance automatic defrost, while the interior freezer compartment is manual defrost to achieve lower storage temperatures ideal for ice cream and other frozen food. The deluxe interior includes adjustable glass shelves for spill-proof storage and easier cleaning, as well as a scalloped wine shelf to hold wine and champagne bottles safely in place. Door racks offer additional convenience for tall bottles and condiments and a clear crisper drawer ensures your produce is stored under the ideal conditions.
