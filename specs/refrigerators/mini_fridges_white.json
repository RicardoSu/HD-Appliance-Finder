        "Description": "The MOMCUBE is a hospital-grade refrigerator designed for mother's milk storage, making it an ideal addition to employee wellness rooms, daycare centers, and work environments seeking to adhere to Section 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The MLRS3MC is laboratory-tested to stay within the CDC's recommended temperature range, whereas similar dorm and residential-style units operate at temperatures that are unsuitable for breast milk storage. Inside, the MLRS3MC has four adjustable wire shelves to ensure proper air circulation. A cycle defrost system allows for little to no maintenance of the unit, while a soft LED light is included with an on/off switch for easy viewing of the interior. The MOMCUBE includes an LED display that allows the user to monitor and change the temperature as needed. Several alarms ensure temperature stability, and the factory-installed external door lock offers added security. The self-closing, reversible door allows for flexibility in unit placement, while the easy-grip handle in blue makes access quick and convenient. This unit is designed for freestanding use.
