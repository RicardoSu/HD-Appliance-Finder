        "Description": "Storing all of your favorite fresh and frozen foods is easy with this 18.7 cu. ft. capacity bottom-freezer refrigerator featuring a convenient freezer drawer that places frozen items in close reach, making it easy to organize and find exactly what you need. You'll be able to keep food at the right temperature without wasting energy thanks to the Accu-Chill temperature management system, which uses built-in sensors to measure internal temperature and activates the compressor only when necessary. That food will look just as it should with energy-efficient LED lights, which cast a more natural light, while the FreshFlow produce preserver extends the freshness of produce for up to 4 days longer to keep fruits and vegetables tasting great.
